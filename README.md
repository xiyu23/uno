# uno
score caculator for UNO, which is a popular desktop card game

# What's it capable of
Without having to write down and caculate everyone's score after each round manually. Instead, all you need is just type in everyone's score, leave the trivialness to the program!

# How to play with it
After the server has been deployed successfully, so create a room then let your partners join in!

# Create a room
Anyone could launch a uno room by typing his nickname, optional the total score if you like. Then click the 'Create Room' button, the room will be created right now.

# Join a room
Anyone could join in a room which must be in status of 'ReadyToPlay'.
By typing a room ID which the room owner holds, player can easily join the same room ID to play together.

# Start game!
Only the room owner(as is 'the player who created the room') can start the game.

# Add everyone's score after a round
After you guys have caculated the score of themselves, the room owner could type in the score one by one to input fields belonging to each player.

# Boom! You reach the limit score! Drop a big red packet :)
The total score set by the room owner is for limiting the biggest score one player could reach. Once someone had reached or exceeded the total score, the game is over.

# Enjoy the naive uno utility :)
